C# Collections
In C#, collection represents group of objects. 
By the help of collections, we can perform various operations on objects such as

* - store object
* - update object
* - delete object
* - retrieve object
* - search object, and
* - sort object

In sort, all the data structure work can be performed by C# collections.

We can store objects in array or collection. 
Collection has advantage over array. 
Array has size limit but objects stored in collection can grow or shrink dynamically.
