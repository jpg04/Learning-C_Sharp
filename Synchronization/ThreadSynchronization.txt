C# Thread Synchronization
Synchronization is a technique that allows only one thread to access the resource for the particular time. 
No other thread can interrupt until the assigned thread finishes its task.

In multithreading program, threads are allowed to access any resource for the required execution time. 
Threads share resources and executes asynchronously. 
Accessing shared resources (data) is critical task that sometimes may halt the system. 
We deal with it by making threads synchronized.

It is mainly used in case of transactions like deposit, withdraw etc.

Advantage of Thread Synchronization
    - Consistency Maintain
    - No Thread Interference

C# Lock
We can use C# lock keyword to execute program synchronously. 
It is used to get lock for the current thread, execute the task and then release the lock. 
It ensures that other thread does not interrupt the execution until the execution finish.

I am creating two examples that executes asynchronously and synchronously.
