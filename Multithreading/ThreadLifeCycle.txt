* C# Thread Life Cycle
    In C#, each thread has a life cycle. 
    The life cycle of a thread is started when instance of System.
    Threading.Thread class is created. 
    When the task execution of the thread is completed, its life cycle is ended.

*There are following states in the life cycle of a Thread in C#.

    -Unstarted
    -Runnable (Ready to run)
    -Running
    -Not Runnable
    -Dead (Terminated)

*Unstarted State
    When the instance of Thread class is created, it is in unstarted state by default.

*Runnable State
    When start() method on the thread is called, it is in runnable or ready to run state.

*Running State
    Only one thread within a process can be executed at a time. 
    At the time of execution, thread is in running state.

*Not Runnable State
    The thread is in not runnable state, if sleep() or wait() method is called on the thread, 
    or input/output operation is blocked.

*Dead State
    After completing the task, thread enters into dead or terminated state.
