C# Multithreading
Multithreading in C# is a process in which multiple threads work simultaneously. 
It is a process to achieve multitasking. It saves time because multiple tasks are being executed at a time. 
To create multithreaded application in C#, we need to use System.Threding namespace.

System.Threading Namespace
The System.Threading namespace contains classes and interfaces to provide 
the facility of multithreaded programming. 
It also provides classes to synchronize the thread resource. 
A list of commonly used classes are given below:

Thread
Mutex
Timer
Monitor
Semaphore
ThreadLocal
ThreadPool
Volatile etc.

Process and Thread
A process represents an application whereas a thread represents a module of the application. 
Process is heavyweight component whereas thread is lightweight. 
A thread can be termed as lightweight subprocess because it is executed inside a process.

Whenever you create a process, a separate memory area is occupied. 
But threads share a common memory area.
